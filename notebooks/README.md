- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, sentiment analysis, and correlation analysis.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for specific analysis tasks or functions.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing all required Python packages and their versions.

## Installation:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it.
3. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to perform the analysis.

## Usage:

- Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for detailed analysis steps and visualizations.
- Modify the code as needed for your specific analysis requirements.
- Refer to the comments and documentation within the code for guidance on each step.
